> A tool to convert my obsidian notes into something that is easier to view in a web browser

Status: prototype

I use a zettelkasten system, the source notes are just a bunch of links.

What this tool does is it compiles source notes into longer files,
leaving the links and the main notes intact if you want them.

I hope that makes sense. I'll write a better readme soon :)
